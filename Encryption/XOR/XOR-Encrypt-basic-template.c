/* Encryption conceals malicious code, making it more difficult for some 
signature based secruity solutions to identify. Encryption is almost always 
necessary for evasion

However, encryption does not effectively combat runtime or heuristic analysis.
Additionally, the more data encrypted in a file the higher its entropy. Files
with high entropy are often flagged for further scrutiny. 

Therefore, encryption is just one aspect which must be included. */
